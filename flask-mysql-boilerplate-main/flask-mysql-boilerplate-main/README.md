#### Preethi Gandluru, Laksh Tyagi, Monisha Kapadia, and Joshua Hill 

This code represents Recflix, which is a program in which there are three 
different types of users each of which have a different functionality 
within Recflix. End users have the ability to browse through movies and 
add them to watch lists. The admin's main function is to add movies 
that have not already been inputted in to Recflix. The critic is able to 
add reviews to existing movies. 

The code is split into multiple different folders. The db folder includes the final db bootstrap with all the necessary data 
required. The flask-app folder includes a src folder that includes a file 
for each persona and all the necessary code for each. The flask-app folder 
also includes an app.py file and the docker file.
